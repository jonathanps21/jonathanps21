## Jonathan Porras Sandi

I am a Computer Engineering student at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (TEC). I am deeply passionate about the world of computer science, and every line of code I write is an opportunity to learn, innovate and create.

🧠 I excel at developing robust and creative solutions, combining logical thinking with imagination to build cool stuff.
🌐 I have a special affinity for web development, where I constantly hone my ideas and skills to design and implement functional, attractive and efficient sites.

Every project is a new adventure, and my goal is to always keep growing as a developer, learning from every challenge and collaborating with other technology enthusiasts.
